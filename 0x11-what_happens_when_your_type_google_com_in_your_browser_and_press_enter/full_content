What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter?

When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a complex chain of
events takes place behind the scenes to deliver the website to your device. In this blog post
,I will explore the various stages involved in this process, including DNS request, TCP/IP, 
Firewall, HTTPS/SSL, Load-balancer, Web server, Application server, and Database.

1. DNS request: The first step in accessing any website is to resolve its domain name
into an IP address. This process is called Domain Name System (DNS) resolution. When
you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser, your device sends a DNS request
to a DNS server to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.
This step is necessary because computers communicate with each other using IP addresses,
not domain names.

2. TCP/IP: Once the IP address is resolved, your device establishes a Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connection with the server hosting the
website. This connection is a reliable and secure way to exchange data between
devices over the internet.

3. Firewall: A Firewall is a security measure that protects servers from
unauthorized access and malicious attacks. The Firewall checks the incoming
traffic to ensure that it complies with the pre-configured rules and policies.
If the traffic is deemed safe, it is allowed to pass through to the next stage
of the process.

4. HTTPS/SSL: The next stage involves establishing a secure connection between
your device and the server using the HTTPS/SSL protocol. HTTPS stands for
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, and SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer.
This protocol ensures that the data exchanged between your device and the
server is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.

5. Load-balancer: A load balancer is a device that distributes incoming traffic
across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overloaded. When you 
access a popular website like Google, there may be thousands of requests coming
in at the same time. A load balancer helps to distribute these requests across 
multiple servers, ensuring that each server has an equal load.

6. Web server: The web server is responsible for serving the requested web pages 
to your device. When you access "https://www.google.com," your request is routed 
to one of Google's many web servers. The web server retrieves the requested web 
pages from its file system and then your expected request for which you press ENTER
is displayed on your device screen.

7.  Application server: The application server is responsible for executing the code
that generates the web page dynamically. In the case of Google, the application server
executes the code that generates the search results page based on the keywords you hav
e entered. The application server communicates with the web server to retrieve any 
required data, such as search results, and formats it into an HTML page that can be 
rendered by your browser.

 8.  Database: The final stage involves retrieving data from the database. The 
application server communicates with the database to retrieve any required data, 
such as user preferences or search history. In the case of Google, the application
server retrieves data from Google's massive database of search results.

In conclusion, typing "https://www.google.com" in your browser and pressing Enter
triggers a complex chain of events involving DNS request, TCP/IP, Firewall, HTTPS/SSL,
Load-balancer, Web server, Application server, and Database. Each of these stages plays
a critical role in delivering the web page to your device. Understanding how these
stages work together can help you appreciate the complexity of the modern internet
and the challenges involved in building and maintaining large-scale web applications.
