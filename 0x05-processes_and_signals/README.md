More Info
For those who want to know more and learn about all signals, check out this article.

0. What is my PID
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

1. List your processes
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:

Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
Display in a user-oriented format
Show process hierarchy

2. Show your Bash PID
mandatory
Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

You cannot use pgrep
The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)

3. Show your Bash PID made easy
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

Requirements:

You cannot use ps

4. To infinity and beyond
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

Requirements:

In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2

5. Don't stop me now!
mandatory
We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You must use kill
Terminal #0

6. Stop me if you can
mandatory
Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You cannot use kill or killall
Terminal #0

7. Highlander
mandatory
Write a Bash script that displays:

To infinity and beyond indefinitely
With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

Terminal #0

8. Beheaded process
mandatory
Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal #0

9. Process and PID file
#advanced
Write a Bash script that:

Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID
Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal

10. Manage my process
#advanced


Read:

&
init.d
Daemon
Positional parameters
man: sudo

Programs that are detached from the terminal and running in the background are called daemons or processes, need to be managed. The general minimum set of instructions is: start, restart and stop. The most popular way of doing so on Unix system is to use the init scripts.

11. Zombie
#advanced


Read what a zombie process is.

Write a C program that creates 5 zombie processes.

Requirements:

For every zombie process created, it displays Zombie process created, PID: ZOMBIE_PID
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
When your code is done creating the parent process and the zombies, use the function bellow
